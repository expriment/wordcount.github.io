  Harper's Island is series television of murders. It's hard for me to understand the killer's logic. I only to say, it's successfull as a horror tv series but failed as a mystery one. Stangerly, the most impressive scene for me is about love. Look at the desperate but relief face below, what are you thinking about?

  Chloe is just a normal girl in this show, she is not super hero, not so brave, and quarrel with cal sometimes. But after trapped in sewer, she got only Cal in mind. when Cal came to save her, Chloe's body and soul are both free. They became true lovers of each other. Then Cal dies for saving her, but she still got no way to escape. I don't know what she thought when she decide to fall off the bridge, but I do know she realized what love is when she said: "you can't have me". At that moment, love to Cal conquer afaid of killer and death, and gave her courage to face her destiny.

  But most lovers don't have that extreme chance to test and upgrade their love. So we just have normal love to conquer normal afaid in normal life.
